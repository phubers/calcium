Calculation functions for contact centers in Python, for use in Python on regular operating systems and on iOS (Pythonista)

Calcium contains a small library of staffing functions that can be used in Python. It contains Erlang C and related functions, in order to calculate staffing requirements for contact centers.
It currently contains a calculator for iOS and for windowed GUI systems that can use tkinter and ttk.

ToDo:

* make calculator robust: currently no input checking is performed. On iOS this risk is mitigated by only allowing the numerical keyboard, but the Windows version does not have any safety.
* calculator required staff for ASA service goal
